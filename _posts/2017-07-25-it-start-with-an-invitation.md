# It Start With an Invitation

At the Agile Professional Learning Network - Chicago Chapter's first Conference, I caught up with Doc Norton. He spoke about the Host Leadership model and its role-based examples, instead of character based traits of Servant Leadership. 

Listen as Doc explains several of the roles that anyone can take on in Host Leadership.

Doc also has a book on Lean Pub right now, Escape Velocity, where he explores more useful metrics than Velocity.
