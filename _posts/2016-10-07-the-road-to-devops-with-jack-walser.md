# The Road to DevOps, with Jack Walser

Join me as I query [Jack Walser][0], of AIM Consulting, on DevOps. Before Jack spoke to the [Agile Professional Learning Network][1] ([APLN -- Chicago][2]) in June, I didn't have a great idea of what DevOps, in the Agile space, really was.

Jack breaks down the components of a DevOps environment needed to succeed.
