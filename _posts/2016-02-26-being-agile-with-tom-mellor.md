About Tom Mellor

Tom Mellor has been a Certified Scrum Trainer since 2008 and was mentored by Scrum co-creator Ken Schwaber.  Tom assumed the Chair of the Board of Directors of the Scrum Alliance following Ken's resignation in 2009\.  He served on the Board at 2008 through September 2010\.  

Tom introduced Scrum into the custom software development department of his Fortune 50 employer in early 2004\.  He was involved in over 50 projects that used Scrum as the framework for development.  He trained over 1,000 employees of the company as Certified ScrumMasters and coached and assisted many more in being agile and using Scrum.

Tom enjoys helping people discover and use modern software product development methods and his purpose is to help others find joy in their work and improve their work environment, their processes, and themselves.   He likes to remind people that Orville Wright did not have a pilot's license and no one should be inhibited or prevented from being happy and creative.  

Tom prefers the same title that Gordon MacKenzie had at Hallmark Cards: "Creative Paradox."  He also believes everyone would benefit from and enjoy reading MacKenzie's gem: _Orbiting the Giant Hairball: A Corporate Fool's Guide to Surviving with Grace_
