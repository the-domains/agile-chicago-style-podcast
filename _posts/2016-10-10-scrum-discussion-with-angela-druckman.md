I sat down with [Angela Druckman][0] (CST) last week and discussed a few topics that greatly concern us both. Angela is a Certified Scrum Trainer, from the Pacific Northwest, who trains in several major markets in the USA, and abroad. She authored [30 Days to Better Agile][1], and is currently working on a new book about Agile Coaching. Her new book will be a companion to an Agile Coaching course that she plans on offering for the first time, this Spring.

Tune in to this episode of the Agile Chicago Style Podcast to hear what Angela calls Stealth Scrum, Progressive Independence, "The Homework", and her arguments and opinions on Prioritized Backlogs vs. Ordered Backlogs, and Methodologies vs. Frameworks. And listen for one great quote from Angela "Good is the enemy of great."
