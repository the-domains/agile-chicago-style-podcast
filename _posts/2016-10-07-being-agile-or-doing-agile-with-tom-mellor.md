# Being Agile or Doing Agile

## with Tom Mellor

The ever-controversial Tom Mellor discusses the differences between 'Being Agile' and 'Doing Agile.' Tom talks quite a bit about Frederic Laloux's organizational paradigms (categorized by a color spectrum), and gets us started down a road that leads to differences in what we are taught about the basic elements of Scrum -- or at least what we thought we were taught.

Tom also qualifies and stands by his statement "I think the ScrumMaster was the worst thing ever created in Scrum" by answering the question "If you don't have a ScrumMaster, how do you expect \[a new Scrum Team\] to become a team that practices Scrum?" --- You have to listen to get his answer
