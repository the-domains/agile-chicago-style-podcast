Agile Coach & Trainer

Rick is an experienced Agile Coach and Trainer with software development experience dating back to 1997\. Many of the projects Rick has been engaged with, early in his career, used XP practices and/or elements of Scrum, and almost always incorporated several, if not all, of the Agile Principles and Values.

Rick has worked with clients at many levels, to train and coach on Agile Practices, assess teams for existing Agile maturity, and to train and mentor future Agile leaders - but he prefers to work with Scrum Teams and Programs.

Rick focuses his efforts on Scrum and Kanban teams using XP practices - assisting with their implementation of Agile processes, team dynamics, and professional development of ScrumMasters and Product Owners.
