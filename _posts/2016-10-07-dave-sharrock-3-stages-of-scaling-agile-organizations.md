  In this episode, please excuse the hacked up sound quality. I didn’t realize
  it while Dave and I were speaking, but I entered into this discussion with
  preconceived ideas of what scaling Agile orgs meant, and it was well reflected
  in my part of the discussion. At times I derailed the conversation, and at
  others, I slowed Dave down from getting his point across. I believe I’ve been
  able to edit the audio back into a semblance of coherent conversation, almost
  simply by editing out some large portions of me talking. So, please enjoy Dr.
  Dave Sharrock speaking about scaling Agile organizations. It’s not necessarily
  all about making your Agile footprint bigger, ideally it’s about making it
  better (and then bigger later).
