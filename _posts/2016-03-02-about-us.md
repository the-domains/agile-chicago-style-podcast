Rick Waters

Founder and Co-Host of Agile Chicago Style

Agile Coach & Trainer

Rick is an experienced Agile Coach and Trainer with more than 17 years of technical software development, and software quality assurance experience.  Many of the project Rick was engaged with, early in his career, used XP practices and/or elements of Scrum, and almost always incorporated several, if not all, of the Agile Principles and Values.

Rick has worked with clients at many levels, to train and coach on Agile Practices, assess teams for existing Agile maturity, and to train and mentor future Agile leaders - but he prefers to work with Scrum Teams and Programs.

Rick focuses his efforts on Scrum, Kanban, and XP teams - assisting with their adoption of Agile processes, engineering practices, team communication skill and dynamics, and professional development of ScrumMasters and Product Owners.
