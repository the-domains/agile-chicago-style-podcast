# An Agile Parable

While chatting with other coaches this morning, we began discussing the confusing and sometimes-nebulous semi-goal of 'high-performance.' I shared a parable. It goes like this...

> I once lived in a town, as a child, where a significant amount of the town's revenue was generated by the leasing out of billboards near highways and around the town. One year, the town passed an ordinance that no structure within town limits could be higher than X. The billboards came down. The town coffers soon went dry. The town raised taxes (luckily by then I had joined the army and left town). After several years, the ordinance was lifted and the billboards (and consequently the revenue) came back. The taxes remained.
> At the end of this story, is the town high-performing? The main metric of the story is revenue. There's more now.

By telling this story, my goal was to provoke thought. And, that's exactly what it did. For me. I have no idea if the others even read my story.

I began thinking about pain. Pain, and how enduring the human spirit is. When we experience a constant pain, we tend to complain about it. Until we stop. Soon after we stop we accept the pain as the new normal.
