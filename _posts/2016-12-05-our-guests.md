# Our Guests

We carefully select the guests on the podcast. If they are not practicing Agile in some way, in Chicago or the outlying areas, they are frequent visitors to the area and have interesting ideas to spread.

**Michael Marchi** - Over a decade ago, Michael turned a quest for project sanity and predictability into a journey that transformed his career. He learned about Agile through the application of XP and Scrum, was asked to develop a training curriculum to share his experiences, and travelled the globe teaching engineer and test teams to follow the Agile path. He is one of the founders of the **Agile Professional Learning Network** of Chicago (_[aplnchicago.org][0]_), a professional meetup group that serves the Chicago Northwest suburbs. He currently works as Delivery Leadership Manager for **Strive Consulting** where he brings form to Strive's ever-expanding Agile service offerings.
