Matt will become the show's new co-host and technical editor. Don't worry, you'll still get to hear me inject more than a few um's and stutters But, you will also get Matt's level-headed observations and ideas!

In this episode, we talk about things we are seeing in the Chicago Agile space as far as Agile implementations, attitudes, practices, and how we've adapted to them.

We talk a little about Doc Norton's presentation at Agile Day Chicago 2015\. Doc has a great new take on the Shu -- Ha -- Ri maturity model.

Rick gives a little detail about an experiment he's looking into with crossing the CSM training class and young students. This gives way to a great discussion on training/educating students.
