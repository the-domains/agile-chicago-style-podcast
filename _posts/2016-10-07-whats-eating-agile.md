Just Matt and Rick for this episode. Matt recalls his experience at a local Agile Meetup -- APLN Chicago. The topic: Culture Eats Agile for Breakfast.

The presenters at this meeting told the story of how they implemented Agile at their organization, but really focused on how they targeted the company culture as something that needed to change along with the development teams.
